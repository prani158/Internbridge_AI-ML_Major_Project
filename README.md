Apple Sales Prediction Project

Overview:

This project involves developing a predictive model to forecast apple sales based on historical sales data and weather conditions. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable model that can help in forecasting future apple sales.

Project Structure:

Data Collection: Historical sales data, weather conditions, and week numbers are gathered.

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.

Feature Selection: Relevant features influencing apple sales are identified and selected.

Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using the processed data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.

Prediction: The trained model is used to predict apple sales and evaluate its accuracy.

Files Included

Results
The model provides predictions of apple sales based on the input data. Performance metrics are reported to evaluate accuracy and reliability.

Limitations:

Data Quality: The model's performance is dependent on the quality of the input data.

Feature Limitations: The model may not include all factors affecting apple sales.

Model Complexity: Linear regression may not capture complex relationships in the data.

Future Work:

Incorporate additional features and external data sources.
